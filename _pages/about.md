Hi, I'm Andrew Yates. I study physics and computer science at Cornell University. Broadly speaking, my interests are quantum computing and quantum information theory, along with their applications to fundamental physics (quantum gravity, condensed matter), machine learning (reservoir computing), and the simulation of physical systems.  

As of Spring 2022, I work with [Peter McMahon's group](https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/) at Cornell and [John Preskill's group](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/) at Caltech. Check my CV for more details!  

In Fall 2022, I will join Harvard University as a Ph.D. student studying theoretical physics - I am part of the inaugural class of [Harvard's new quantum Ph.D. program](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/04/harvard-launches-new-ph-d-program-in-quantum-science/).
