Hi, I'm Andrew Yates. As of Fall 2022, I will join Harvard University as a Ph.D. student studying theoretical physics - I am part of the inaugural class of [Harvard's new quantum Ph.D. program](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/04/harvard-launches-new-ph-d-program-in-quantum-science/). Before that, I studied physics and computer science at Cornell.

My interests are quantum computing and quantum information theory, along with their applications to fundamental physics, machine learning (reservoir computing), and the simulation of physical systems.  

I worked with [Peter McMahon's group](https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/) at Cornell and [John Preskill's group](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/) at Caltech. Check my CV for more details!    

This website is still under construction.
