Education
======
* B.A. in Physics, Cornell University, 2022 (expected)
<!-- * *Minor*: Computer Science, *Concentration*: Mathematics -->
* *Selected coursework*: Quantum Information Processing, Blackholes and Quantum Information (Grad), Relativistic Quantum Field Theory (Grad), Quantum I-III, Solid State Physics, Applied Functional Analysis (Grad), Mathematical Methods for Information Science, Large Scale Machine Learning.

Research experience
======
*Research supervisors (faculty members) are in bold.*
* April 2021 - present: Many-body Quantum Teleportation and Holography
  * Mentors: **John Preskill**, Sepehr Nezami
  * Caltech
  * Studying the effects of noise on ‘quantum gravity in the lab’ experiments with near-term quantum computers, based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01064. Using techniques from quantum information and random matrix theory such as quantum error correction, unitary t-designs, the Clifford group, and operator growth, discovered unexpected noise resilience.

* October 2019 - present: Quantum Reservoir Computing
  * Mentors: **Peter McMahon**, Logan Wright
  * Cornell University
  * Theoretical and simulation work in quantum machine learning. Created, implemented, and testing a circuit-model quantum machine learning algorithm based on the principles of classical reservoir computing. This project includes quantum matrix inversion (HHL), quantum linear regression, and quantum random access memory.
 
* August 2020 - March 2021: Thermal States of SYK for Quantum Simulation
  * Mentors: **Peter McMahon**, **Paul Ginsparg**, Thomas Hartman, Eliott Rosenberg
  * Cornell University
  * Implemented variational quantum algorithms to prepare thermofield double states of SYK for quantum simulation applications, and simulated Hamiltonians that are dual to certain gravitational systems under the AdS/CFT correspondence. Implemented the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transformations, error mitigation techniques for TFD state preparation, and methods for measuring von Neumann and Rényi entropies of fermionic systems with quantum circuits.

* June 2019 - October 2019: Noise Resilient Quantum Circuits
  * Mentors: **Peter McMahon**
  * Cornell University
  * Simulated ‘noise resilient quantum circuits’ (based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00032) which are ‘Markovian’ and ‘locally rapidly mixing’. Created methods to numerically diagnose the two properties. Found equivalent, tensor network descriptions of the same phenomena – providing elegant analytic tools. Cataloged simple noise resilient circuits.

* January 2020 - present: Quantum Neural Networks
  * Mentors: **Peter McMahon**
  * Cornell University
  * Mentors an undergraduate research group. Developed two projects concerning quantum neural networks. First, to use quantum chaos theory to diagnose barren plateaus (an issue where QNNs become untrainable after becoming sufficiently random). Second, to mitigate training noise by using techniques of classical transfer learning theory.

Skills
======
* Quantum computation, quantum information theory, quantum simulation, quantum chaos, and random matrix theory.
* Quantum machine learning, quantum linear algebra algorithms, unitary t-designs, and the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev model.
* Classical reservoir computing, extreme learning machines, and quantum reservoir computing.
* Software packages: Cirq, Qiskit, Qutip, Pennylane, Tensorflow, Tensorflow Quantum, and OpenFermion.
